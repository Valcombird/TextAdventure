Seeing how much I can do in C++

7/8
Combat
	Fiddled with formulas
		Now it's player/npc attack - .1 of npc/player def for regular attacks
		Then 0.5 for critical hits
	Fixed Strike up more so it deals more damage more often
NPCs
	Added orc encounter fully
Classes
	Tweaked level up to add MP per level
	Fixed the dialogue more
	Lowered amount of xp to level up all around

7/7
Skills System
	Skill menu working
	Strike works (need to work on algorithm for damage)
	Recognizes if you don't know that skill yet
	Checks for MP requirement
	Display MP
Taking actions
	Now able to check stats on the go
Combat
	Fixed some discrepencies with HP not being shown
	Fixed XP giving so it actually gives XP instead of adding to the XP requried to level
	Fixed NPC heal so it continues combat instead of going to action screen

7/6
Been a while...
Skill System
	Skills require MP
	Strike skill for warrior in the make
	Heal is a skill
	Cleaned up some code (Maybe)
Skill menu for combat (semi-working)

3/12
Combat System
	Healing
	Turn based
	RNG for npc and player
	RNG for npc to heal
	Working npcs
	Level up system
	Pathing
Further optimized?
More cases
NPCs
Some more NPCs with no stats
NPC getter and setter for stats/xp
More?

3/11
Pathing
	RNG based (not really)
	Trap system initialized
	Switches versus maps/factories still considering
	HP system integration for traps (for now)
	That's about it... Oh and realized I could use HTML in this.. Going to leave the rest sloppy to show I do it on this day.

3/10 DoorHandler Open the door... RoomHandler Random number = random encounter CombatHandler In progress

3/9 Decided on vectors. Got class system working even more. Pathing system started?

3/8 Started. Got nothing done really because ran into common errors. Got a somewhat basic class system working? Maybe.
