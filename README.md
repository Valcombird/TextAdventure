Seeing how much I can do in C++

Uhhh this isn't complete, and might never be. I am just simply figuring out what I know in C++ and what I don't know and seeing what I can build.
Hoping to learn more than I do. 

Thanks for looking I guess.

Been a while...<br>
Skill System
<ul>
  <li>Skills require MP</li>
  <li>Strike skill for warrior in the make</li>
  <li>Heal is a skill</li>
  <Straight shot for archer in the make</li>
</ul>
Cleaned up some code (Maybe)

Combat System
<ul>
  <li>Healing</li>
  <li>Turn based</li>
  <li>RNG for npc and player</li>
  <li>RNG for npc to heal</li>
  <li>Working npcs</li>
  <li>Level up system</li>
  
</ul>
Pathing
<ul>
  <li>Further optimized?</li>
  <li>More cases</li>
</ul>
NPCs
<ul>
  <li>Some more NPCs with no stats</li>
  <li>NPC getter and setter for stats/xp</li>

More?

Pathing
<ul>
  <li>RNG based (not really)</li>
  <li>Trap system initialized</li>
  <li>Switches versus maps/factories still considering</li>
  <li>HP system integration for traps (for now)</li>
</ul>
That's about it... Oh and realized I could use HTML in this.. Going to leave the rest sloppy to show I do it on this day.

Decided on vectors.
Got class system working even more.
Pathing system started?

3/8
Started. Got nothing done really because ran into common errors. Got a somewhat basic class system working? Maybe.
