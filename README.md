Seeing how much I can do in C++

Uhhh this isn't complete, and might never be. I am just simply figuring out what I know in C++ and what I don't know and seeing what I can build.
Hoping to learn more than I do. 

Thanks for looking I guess.

Started. Got nothing done really because ran into common errors. Got a somewhat basic class system working? Maybe.
